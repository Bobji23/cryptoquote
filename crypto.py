#Program for generating the Crypto Quote

#Read the file
#For each line, construct a “Quote” object
#Add that Quote to a collection
#Create a “CryptoQuote” for each quote in the selection.
#Display all the “CryptoQuotes” as HTML

#============================================================



#1. Class for representing a single QUOTE
# id, quote, author, submitted_by
# _repr__ and __str__
# TODO: ______
class Quote:
    


#2. Class for representing all the quotes (quotes collection).
# This class represents a collection of quotes
# _repr__ and __str__
# TODO: ________
class QuotesList:



# Method for creating the  Quote object
# INPUT: one line of string
# OUTPUT: the quotes object
# Assume file_name is quotes_in_excel.csv
# And further assume that the file is in the same directory as python file
def process_file(file_name):
    #this method reads the file
    # creates a list of lines
    # where each line represents a quote
    # each line is split into four fields
    # and a quote object is created
    # then the created object is added to QuotesList
    # by the time, the process_file method is done, we will have a QuotesList collection



# Program execution
# quotes_list = process_file("quotes_in_excel.csv")
# print(quotes_list)
